# MicroProject2
This project is a simple yet structured backend application built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB (Atlas), designed to demonstrate the Create operation of a RESTful API. Following the MEN architecture, the project features a clean folder structure with models, routes, and controllers, and connects securely to a cloud MongoDB database using environment variables. The app uses Mongoose to define a schema with validations, and data can be added using POST requests via POSTMAN. This microproject reflects a foundational understanding of backend development and CRUD logic in a professional setup.
